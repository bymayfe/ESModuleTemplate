# Welcome to ESModuleTemplate !

Hi, I'm leaving you a little present. **Discord.JS for v13**, I have developed an infrastructure with **class function** and **ESModules(MJS)** that will provide you with complete convenience. I would like to share it. Use it on good days. Stay healthy.

# Installation
Download or import this template, then open a folder called **TXT**, and then open 3 subfolders called **eval - lyrics - TXTSend** into the **TXT** folder. Then type 
> Note: Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16+ to run.
```j
npm i @latest
``` 
or  (module name)
```j
npm i modulename@latest
``` 
into the terminal and run it.
After the installation of the modules is complete, the installation is complete.

- If you get an error downloading the module "quick.db", you can delete the module "quick.db".

## Run Template

**config.js** token entering the token of the short bot will make the bot work. You can also change the prefix, developer, and owners.
